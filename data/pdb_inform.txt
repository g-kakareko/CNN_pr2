The lines that start with ">" are comments. In the dataset, comments and
sequences with ambiguous amino acid types are removed, resulting in 440115
sequences. 

Each line contains one protein sequence.
Here are the encodings of the amino acid types:

Amino acid			Three letter code	One letter code
alanine				ala			A
arginine			arg			R
asparagine			asn			N
aspartic acid			asp			D
*asparagine or aspartic acid	asx			B (D or N)
cysteine			cys			C
glutamic acid			glu			E
glutamine			gln			Q
*glutamine or glutamic acid	glx			Z (E or Q)
glycine				gly			G
histidine			his			H
isoleucine			ile			I
leucine				leu			L
*leucine or isoleucine					J (I or L)
lysine				lys			K
methionine			met			M
phenylalanine			phe			F
*pyrrolysine						O
proline				pro			P
serine				ser			S
*selenocysteine			sel			U (replaced by C)
threonine			thr			T
tryptophan			trp			W
tyrosine			tyr			Y
valine				val			V
any							X

Here are the frequencies of the amino acid types in the dataset (with

Note that the lines with "*" indicate ambiguous or types that should not
exist in the sequences. Those have been removed. In case that you like to 
know the protein sequences and find more information about them, you can
find them in pdb_seqres_org.txt by matching the sequences. pdb_seqres_org.txt
contains 461,504 sequences with comments (the protein names).
